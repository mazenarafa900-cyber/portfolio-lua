Hi! I’m a 15-year-old Roblox developer and intermediate scripter. My videos may not look super professional, but they show that my scripts actually work. I can create a variety of systems, focusing on making them simple, effective, and easy to use.

I specialize in gamepass systems, shop systems, data storage, GUIs, and more. My services are affordable and straightforward. You can see examples of my work in the files, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask. I can script items purchasable with in-game money or Robux. Whatever your script idea is, we can discuss it in my DMs.
