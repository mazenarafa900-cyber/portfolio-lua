Hi! I’m a 15yo Roblox developer and an intermediate scripter. My videos may not look super professional, but they prove that my scripts work. I can script a variety of systems, and I focus on making them simple, effective, and easy to use.

I specialize in gamepass systems, shop systems, data storing, GUIs, and more. My services are affordable and straightforward. You can see examples of my work in the files, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask. I can script items purchasable with in-game money or Robux. whatever your script idea is we could discuss it in my dms,
